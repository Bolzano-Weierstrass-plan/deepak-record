|10.| &#x2611; | 08/29/2023 | Today was my burnout day and I took some time off. Moving on forward, I am going to work very hard and very efficient everyday and take a burn out day break whenever I see fit. The aim here is to improve my resistence to burn out days and reduce my recovery time eventually. I watched a movie called **The Big Short** which is a movie about investors who made profit off of the global economic crisis of 2008. After watching that movie, I am certain of one thing: One **big WIN** can nullify a million failures. Therefore, from now on, I am going to chase that **big WIN.** The plan is to keep chasing big wins after big wins as you keep achieving them. GAME ON AND FINGERS CROSSED ðŸ¤ž
| 9. | &#x2611; | 08/28/2023 | Not very eventful. Got some work done at Raven Industries but nothing major |
| 8. | **Fail** | 08/27/2023 | Sleep deprived and couldn't focus on keeping my mental strength in place. Gave in to phone addiction and haven't worked out for 3 hours this week |
| 7. | &#x2611; | 08/26/2023 | Gave a presentation about GardenM8 to gardeners from 8 different states. The response was very well and we are hoping to go national as soon as possible |
| 6. | &#x2611; | 08/25/2023 | Entire day spent on traveling |
| 5. | &#x2611; | 08/24/2023 | Normal work day |
| 4. | **Fail**| 08/23/2023 | Failed at work |
| 3. | &#x2611; | 08/22/2023 | NA |
| 2. | &#x2611;| 08/21/2023 | This was my second day following the **Bolzano-Weierstrass Plan.** Staying away from my phone during work was a bit easy due to the set time expectations. However, staying away from it during personal project time was harder than I thought. I learned that whenever I face a challenging problem, my body automatically tries to make me stop thinking about the problem. But, when I stay consistent, I am able to solve problems that I would have given up if I took the short-term comforting option. |
