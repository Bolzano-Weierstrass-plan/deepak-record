| 8. | **Fail** | 08/27/2023 | Sleep deprived and couldn't focus on keeping my mental strength in place. Gave in to phone addiction and haven't worked out for 3 hours this week |
| 7. | &#x2611; | 08/26/2023 | Gave a presentation about GardenM8 to gardeners from 8 different states. The response was very well and we are hoping to go national as soon as possible |

| 5. | &#x2611; | 08/24/2023 | Normal work day |
| 4. | **Fail**| 08/23/2023 | Failed at work |
| 3. | &#x2611; | 08/22/2023 | NA |
| 2. | &#x2611;| 08/21/2023 | This was my second day following the **Bolzano-Weierstrass Plan.** Staying away from my phone during work was a bit easy due to the set time expectations. However, staying away from it during personal project time was harder than I thought. I learned that whenever I face a challenging problem, my body automatically tries to make me stop thinking about the problem. But, when I stay consistent, I am able to solve problems that I would have given up if I took the short-term comforting option. |
