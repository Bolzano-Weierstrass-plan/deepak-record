| 2  | &#x2611;| 08/21/2023 | This was my second day following the **Bolzano-Weierstrass Plan.** Staying away from my phone during work was a bit easy due to the set time expectations. However, staying away from it during personal project time was harder than I thought. I learned that whenever I face a challenging problem, my body automatically tries to make me stop thinking about the problem. But, when I stay consistent, I am able to solve problems that I would have given up if I took the short-term comforting option. |
